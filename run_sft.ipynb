    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to perform Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), the first step in our two-stage process to improve our model's performance in providing student support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Supervised Fine-tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "SFT is a crucial first step in model customization because it teaches the model to generate responses that align with specific desired behaviors. In our educational context, this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Knowledge Adaptation**: We start with a pre-trained language model (Llama 3.2) that has broad knowledge but isn't specifically tuned for educational support\n",
    "2. **Task-Specific Learning**: Through SFT, we teach the model to generate responses that embody effective teaching practices\n",
    "3. **Foundation for Further Refinement**: This creates a foundation that will be further improved through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Application\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will be **fine-tuning the model on our dataset of revised responses** (generated in `generate_dataset.ipynb`). This dataset contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: Original user prompts from our dataset\n",
    "- **Target**: Revised, improved responses that demonstrate effective teaching practices like:\n",
    "  - Encouraging critical thinking\n",
    "  - Providing appropriate scaffolding\n",
    "  - Fostering curiosity and exploration\n",
    "  - Making connections to broader concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "After this initial training, we'll use DPO to further refine the model's ability to select optimal responses for educational scenarios."

    "\n",
    "This section sets up the configuration for our Supervised Fine-tuning using the Unsloth-optimized Llama 3.2 model. We've made specific choices in our configuration to balance training efficiency with model performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Configuration\n",
    "- **Base Model**: Llama 3.2 (1B parameter version)\n",
    "  - Why this model?\n",
    "    - Smaller size (1B parameters) makes it practical for fine-tuning on limited hardware\n",
    "    - Built on Meta's Llama architecture, known for good performance on instruction-following tasks\n",
    "    - Optimized by Unsloth for efficient training\n",
    "- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) Parameters**:\n",
    "  - Rank (r): 8 - Determines the complexity of adaptations we can learn\n",
    "  - Alpha: 8 - Scales the impact of our LoRA adaptations\n",
    "  - Dropout: 0 - We disable dropout since we're doing limited training\n",
    "  - Why LoRA? It allows efficient fine-tuning by modifying only a small number of parameters while maintaining model quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Optimization\n",
    "- 4-bit quantization enabled (bnb-4bit)\n",
    "  - Why? Reduces memory usage by ~75% while maintaining most of the model's performance\n",
    "  - Enables training on consumer-grade hardware\n",
    "  - Particularly important for efficient fine-tuning of transformer models\n",
    "\n",

    "- Training data: `data/train_dataset.csv`\n",
    "- Validation data: `data/val_dataset.csv`\n",
    "- Special tokens for structured conversations:\n",

    "  - Model response: `<start_header_id>assistant<end_header_id>`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Parameters\n",
    "These parameters are chosen to provide stable training while preventing overfitting:\n",
    "- Batch size: 2 per device\n",
    "- Gradient accumulation steps: 4\n",
    "  - Effectively simulates a larger batch size of 8\n",
    "- Learning rate: 2e-4 with linear scheduler\n",
    "  - Conservative learning rate to prevent unstable training\n",
    "- Training duration: 30 steps with 5 warmup steps\n",
    "- Optimizer: 8-bit AdamW with 0.01 weight decay\n",

Conventional agricultural practices, historically prioritizing short-term profit over long-term sustainability, have demonstrably contributed to soil erosion, water pollution, biodiversity loss, and significant greenhouse gas emissions.  This reliance on synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and intensive monoculture farming has, in many ways, jeopardized the very resources upon which our future food security depends.\\n\\nHowever, a powerful alternative is emerging: sustainable agriculture. This approach transcends simply \\u2018farming\\u2019; it represents a holistic philosophy centered on ecological principles, social equity, and economic viability.  Rather than viewing agriculture as a purely extractive industry, sustainable practices recognize the inherent value of natural ecosystems and seek to work *with* them, rather than against them.\\n\\nThis research paper delves into the critical importance and evolving landscape of sustainable agriculture.  Specifically, it will explore [**Clearly state your research focus here \\u2013 e.g., \\u201cthe impact of cover cropping on soil health in [specific region],\\u201d or \\u201ca comparative analysis of organic farming systems and their economic performance\\u201d**].  We will examine key components of sustainable agriculture, including practices like crop rotation, integrated pest management, reduced tillage, and agroforestry, and analyze their potential to mitigate the negative impacts of conventional farming. \\n\\nFurthermore, this paper will investigate [**Mention key aspects you\\u2019ll discuss \\u2013 e.g., \\u201cthe challenges and barriers to widespread adoption,\\u201d \\u201cthe role of policy and consumer demand,\\u201d or \\u201cspecific case studies demonstrating successful implementation\\u201d**]. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how we can transition towards a more resilient, equitable, and environmentally sound food system \\u2013 a system capable of nourishing both people and the planet.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To help me tailor this even further, could you tell me:**\\n\\n*   **What is the specific focus of your research paper?** (e.g., a particular technique, region, or aspect of sustainability?)\\n*   **What are the main arguments or findings you'll be presenting?**\\n*   **What is the overall goal of your paper?** (e.g., to advocate for a specific policy, to analyze a specific case study, to propose a new approach?)\",\n          \"To solve the algebraic expression (5x - 3)(2x + 4), we need to expand it by multiplying each term in the first parenthesis by each term in the second parenthesis.\\n\\n(5x - 3)(2x + 4) = (5x)(2x) + (5x)(4) + (-3)(2x) + (-3)(4)\\n= 10x^2 + 20x - 6x - 12\\n= 10x^2 + (20x - 6x) - 12\\n= 10x^2 + 14x - 12\\n\\nSo, (5x - 3)(2x + 4) = 10x^2 + 14x - 12.\\n\\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\\\boxed{10x^2 + 14x - 12}$\",\n          \"Okay, here are a few drafts of an email requesting feedback on your latest marketing campaign, ranging from more formal to slightly more casual.

Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how we can transition towards a more resilient, equitable, and environmentally sound food system \\u2013 a system capable of nourishing both people and the planet, informed by insights from public health, economics, and social sciences.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\",\n          \"To solve (5x - 3)(2x + 4), we need to expand this expression using the distributive property. This property essentially means multiplying each term inside the first set of parentheses by each term inside the second set of parentheses.\\n\\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\\n\\n1. **Multiply the first term of the first set by both terms of the second set:**  (5x)(2x) + (5x)(4) = 10x\\u00b2 + 20x\\n\\n2. **Multiply the second term of the first set by both terms of the second set:** (-3)(2x) + (-3)(4) = -6x - 12\\n\\n3. **Combine the results:** 10x\\u00b2 + 20x - 6x - 12\\n\\n4. **Combine like terms:**  10x\\u00b2 + (20x - 6x) - 12 = 10x\\u00b2 + 14x - 12\\n\\nTherefore, (5x - 3)(2x + 4) = 10x\\u00b2 + 14x - 12.\\n\\nThe distributive property is key here: we\\u2019re distributing the \\u20185x\\u2019 across the \\u20182x + 4\\u2019 and the \\u2018-3\\u2019 across the \\u20182x + 4\\u2019.  This ensures we multiply *every* term in the first parenthesis by *every* term in the second, giving us a fully expanded expression.  Remember, expanding expressions like this is a fundamental skill in algebra, and understanding the distributive property is crucial for success.\",\n          \"Okay, let\\u2019s revamp the email to be more interactive and engaging.

       "\"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCan you design a logo for my school's robotics club?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOkay, let’s design a logo for your school’s robotics club! That’s fantastic – a great way to visually represent your team’s spirit. I want to make sure we’re on the same page about how logos work, so let’s talk through some ideas and clarify a few things.\\n\\nWe’ll explore three distinct concepts, and I’ll explain the thinking behind each one. Importantly, logo design isn’t just about making something “cool”; it’s about communicating your club’s identity – what you’re about.\\n\\n**Concept 1: The Dynamic Gear**\\n\\n* **Image:** A stylized, slightly angled gear. The gear isn't perfectly symmetrical, suggesting movement and energy. Within the gear, you see a simplified silhouette of a robot arm (or a stylized ‘R’ shape).\\n* **Colors:**\\n    * **Primary:** Electric Blue (#007bff) – Blue is often associated with intelligence, technology, and trust – really good choices for a robotics club! It's a color that feels reliable and innovative.\\n    * **Secondary:** Gray (#495057) – Provides a solid, grounding element representing the mechanical aspects of robotics.\\n    * **Accent:** Bright Yellow (#ffc107) – Adds a spark of creativity and enthusiasm. Yellow is energetic and optimistic.\\n* **Font:** A modern, slightly rounded sans-serif font like Montserrat or Open Sans.\\n* **Symbolism:** The gear immediately conveys robotics and engineering. The robot arm within the gear represents the club’s focus on building and designing robots. The angled design suggests dynamism and progress.\\n* **Why this works:** We’re using color psychology – selecting colors that *represent* the qualities we want associated with your club.  It’s not just about picking colors we like; it's about choosing colors that communicate effectively.\\n\\n**Concept 2: The Rising Circuit**\\n\\n* **Image:** A simplified, upward-pointing circuit board path, subtly forming the shape of a rising star or a stylized upward arrow.\\n* **Colors:**\\n    * **Primary:** Teal (#008080) – Teal combines the intelligence of blue with the growth aspect of green – representing progress.\\n    * **Secondary:** Light Gray (#e9ecef) – Provides a clean background and highlights the circuit path.\\n    * **Accent:** Orange (#ffa726) – A pop of color representing energy and success.\\n* **Font:** A clean, geometric sans-serif font like Futura or Lato.\\n* **Symbolism:** The circuit represents the technical foundation of robotics. The upward movement symbolizes progress, ambition, and achieving goals.\\n* **Why this works:**  We're building on symbolic meaning, too. The upward direction isn’t just aesthetically pleasing; it suggests a future-oriented mindset.\\n\\n**Concept 3: Robot Head Silhouette**\\n\\n* **Image:** A simplified, friendly silhouette of a robot head – maybe slightly tilted, giving it a playful, approachable look.\\n* **Colors:**\\n    * **Primary:** Deep Purple (#6f42c1) - Represents intelligence, creativity, and imagination.\\n    * **Secondary:** White (#ffffff) – For highlights and details, creating contrast.\\n    * **Accent:** Neon Green (#39ff14) - A pop of color to indicate energy and excitement.\\n* **Font:** A slightly quirky, rounded sans-serif font like Nunito or Cabin.\\n* **Symbolism:** Directly represents the club's interest in robots. The friendly silhouette suggests a welcoming and inclusive environment.\\n* **Why this works:** Simpler is often better! A clear, recognizable image is easier to remember and understand.\\n\\n\\n**Important Notes & Next Steps:**\\n\\n*   **Iteration is Key:** Logo design isn't a one-shot deal. We'll likely explore several variations, and your feedback will be *essential* in shaping the final design.\\n*   **File Formats:** We'll ultimately need a vector file (like an SVG – this is important because it can be scaled up or down without losing quality). We'll also create versions for web and social media (PNG or JPG).\\n*   **Let's Talk:** I want to hear *your* ideas! Do you have specific colors you’d like to use? Are there particular elements (like a specific type of robot) you’d like to emphasize?\\n\\nTo help me create a logo *specifically* for your club, could you tell me:\\n\\n1.  What is the name of your robotics club?\\n2.  What is the overall tone you’re going for? (e.g., serious and technical, fun and playful, innovative and futuristic)\\n3.  Are there any specific elements you’d like to see included? (e.g., a specific type of robot, a particular color scheme, a symbol representing teamwork)\\n4.  What is the style you prefer? (e.g., minimalist, geometric, illustrative, vintage)\\n5.  Does your school have any existing colors or branding guidelines that we should consider?\\n\\nLet’s work together to create a fantastic logo for your club!<|eot_id|>\""
