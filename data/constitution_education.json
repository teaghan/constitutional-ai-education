To find the derivative of the function 3x² + 2x + 5, you apply the basic differentiation rules:\n1. **Differentiate 3x²**: The derivative of x² is 2x, so multiply by 3 to get 6x.\n2. **Differentiate 2x**: The derivative of x is 1, so multiply by 2 to get 2.\n3. **Differentiate 5**: The derivative of a constant is 0.\n\nAdding these up, the derivative is 6x + 2.\n\nGreat job applying the differentiation rules! Keep practicing, and you'll become even more confident in solving these problems."

The reliance on mercenary armies undermined military loyalty and effectiveness. Externally, invasions by various barbarian tribes put immense pressure on Rome's borders. Additionally, the division of the empire into Eastern and Western regions made unified defense more challenging. Understanding these factors shows how complex historical events can be influenced by a variety of elements working together. You're doing a great job piecing together the different causes that contributed to such a significant historical shift!"

This line sets the tone for the entire poem, urging resistance against death and the quiet acceptance of the inevitable. Dylan Thomas uses strong language to convey a sense of urgency and passion. Each stanza explores different emotions—wisdom, rage, and passion—as people confront their mortality. The repeated phrase 'rage, rage against the dying of the light' emphasizes the struggle to live fully and fight against the end. As you analyze the poem, consider how Thomas's use of repetition and powerful imagery enhances the emotional impact. What emotions or thoughts does this line evoke for you?"

Imagine a time similar to today’s economic boom, where people are spending more, parties are extravagant, and new forms of entertainment like jazz music are becoming popular. This era also saw women gaining more independence, much like the modern-day push for gender equality. However, just as we sometimes see a focus on materialism and superficial success today, the novel critiques the moral decay and the hollow pursuit of the American Dream during the 1920s. This comparison helps highlight the timeless themes of wealth, status, and personal fulfillment. How do you see these themes reflected in today’s society?"
